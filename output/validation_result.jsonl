"The techniques used for automated defect detection in the project worked on with an IISc incubated startup included comparing various techniques like Template Matching, One Class Classification, and Clustering for defect detection in different train parts. Additionally, the accuracy of the EMPad defect classification model was improved from 75% to 98% with Transfer Learning using the ResNet18 architecture. Furthermore, a OneClassClassification model was deployed for open/closed door classification with a 0.99 AUC value for a skewed dataset【7†source】."
